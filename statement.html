<hr>

			<p> I throughly enjoyed this project because it gave me the opportunity to pushed and challeng myself to explore HTML and CSS more than I've had in any of my other classes. The style that I was creating was to be clean and slick with a lot of pictures. I was basing the design off <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com" target="_blank">National Geographic's</a> site. I liked how there's always something to look at, and how user friendly it is. The site, despite all the different images, has the same color scheme for cohesion, something I tried to add in my site. My color scheme was a combination of elephant gray, because elephants are my favorite animal; light purple, favorite color; and green, second favorite color. Those are the colors I chose for Exercise 04, but I had to altered them a bit so they would work with one another rather than clashing. For the images, I chose pictures that I took; images from my personal portfolio as well as images from my work portfolio. I included links to my portfolio, but chose the pictures with the same type of color scheme as the website. As for the font, I chose "'EB Garamond', serif". I wanted the font to be stylish enough to be noticed, but plain enough to not be distracting. I thought that it paired well with the "clean" style I was creating. If you want to look at other examples of a Micro-Site, check out <a href="https://hobbsna.github.io" target="_blank">Nathan Hobbs</a>, who is also in SMAD 307!</p>

			<p> The images I added are a combination of photos taken outside of school and work and then photos that I took for work. Since this is so, I added a link to the Technology and Design flicker page which shows not only my photos, but also my co-workers. I then added a link to my personal Flicker. As for the other links, I chose to link my work (TAD), the website I created from Studying Abroad in Ireland, Summer 2019. I also added a link to my LinkdeIn along with JMU's homepage and SMAD's. I tried to include all the necessary links and information that relate to my work and me as a student and individual.</p>

			<p> I learned a lot from creating this website. I learned new codes and am no longer scared of CSS. Before, I was always nervous to work with CSS and have it linked to my HTML site, but through this project, I have begun to get more comfortable in my abilities with the code. I want to continue adjusting my site to where it is at the point where I can showcase my work on my resume. I also want to continue to learn and grow so I can reach the point where I can fix other people's or companies sites. A company that does what I would like to start doing is <a href="https://blinkux.com/services/interaction-design?campaignid=7999553506&adgroupid=80664399297&adid=396695818794&gclid=CjwKCAiA7t3yBRADEiwA4GFlI63SjdK5U0r02Z6bvuKf-iasuhQ3LJm5RSzGs2alUD4yArv6jyOiNhoCTdsQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Blink</a>. They are a team of designers that work with clients, companies, and other teams in turning data into information. They design webpages and interactive platforms. I feel that the skills needed for designing interactive digital products are strong attributes to have in a world where the connection between users and products are growing.
