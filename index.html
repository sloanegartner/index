			<p>  I am currently double majoring in Psychology and Interactive Design at <span class="purple">James Madison University</span>. I am also an employee at Technology and Design, where I work as a photographer for University Unions. Being a Junior is exciting, but also nerve racking being so close to Senior year and graduating. One of the things I love about Madison is the pride everyone has from being a Duke and everyone holding doors. My favorite places at JMU are Carrier Library (cozy!), The Stadium, Quad, Madison Union, and Lakeside. Also at Madison, I play on the <span class="purple">Club Field Hockey</span> team and am currently the treasurer. Over the years I've played soccer, tennis, softball, track, and lacrosse before I landed on field hockey. It is one of my favorite pass times when I'm not in class or doing homework. </p>

			<p>I was born in Washington D.C and grew up in Arlington VA. My parents met at JMU, my brother graduated from JMU, and my younger brother is currently a freshman here, so being a Duke runs in the <span class="purple">family</span>. My older brother, sister, and younger brother are studying Engineering and my younger sister is still in High School. The best part of going home is seeing me dogs!</p>
